## Exercise 1: Initializing git (4 Points)

### Exercise 1d: 
#### Strengths of Git: 
#### 1.: Distributed Version Control
#### 2.: Branching and Merging
#### Weaknesses of Git:
#### 1.: Complexity for Beginners
#### 2.: Potential for Conflicts

## Exercise 2: Putting your Repository on GitHub (3.5 Points)

### Exercise 2a,b,c:

## Exercise 3: Baby-Names in Munich (3.5 Points)

b)  Load the data for both years into R. Check the type of the count
    variable ("Anzahl") and look into the data to determine why it is
    not numeric? Fix the problem in an appropriate manner, it is OK if
    some of the counts are inaccurate because of this. Explain your
    solution and the repercussions.

c)  Calculate the total number of babies born in Munich in 2022
    and 2023. Which year had the bigger baby-boom?

d)  Add a new column `year` to both datasets which holds the correct
    year for each.

e)  Combine both datasets into one using `bind_rows()`.

f)  Combine the counts for same names to determine the most popular
    names across both years. Print out the top 10 names in a nicely
    formatted table for both years. Include a table caption.

## Exercise 4: Open Analysis (4 points)

This exercise is a bit more open-ended. You can choose any dataset from
[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) and analyze it, while
determining the research question yourself.

a)  Go to <https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets>
    and choose a dataset that interests you. You can have a look at
    <https://ourworldindata.org/> to gather some inspiration.
b)  Download the dataset and track it in git.
c)  Put the name / title of the dataset and a link to it below.

-   Dataset Name: ...
-   Link: <https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/>...

d)  Come up with a (research) question you want to answer with the data
    and briefly explain why you believe this is an interesting question
    within one sentence. It should be a question that can be answered
    with the dataset and using R.
e)  Use R to answer your chosen question.
f)  Create a meaningful plot / figure with the dataset. Make sure to
    provide a figure caption (via the chunk options / Rmarkdown) and
    correctly label the figure.
